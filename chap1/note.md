1. 3 kinds of patterns: creational, structual, Behavioral patterns
-----
# 1.1 what is OOP

1.1.1 object
    have attributes
    have method to manipulating attributes

1.1.2 the 3 elements

* Objects

    in program, it is the objects that finish the task

* Classes

* Methods

1.1.3 major aspects

* encapsulation
    
    object keep its state private

    client can't change object's state directly, it can only send message, object responde by `set` or `get` method

    __var make accessibility provate

* polymorphism
    
    2 types:
        
        an object provices different implementations of the method based on input parameters

        Or the same interface used by objects of different types

* inheritance
* abstraction

    provide interface

* composition
    
    A use B's method withou inherit B

  

# 1.2 OOP principles

1.2.1 the open/close principle
    
* classes or objects and methods should open for extension but closed for modifications

* like: extend the abstract base class rather than modify the abstract base class

1.2.2 the inversion of control principle

* the base module and dependent module should be decoupled with an abstraction layer in between

1.2.3 the interface segregation principle

1.2.4 the single responsibility principle

1.2.5 the substibution principle

* the derived class must be able to completely substitute the base class

# what is design patterns (DP)

# patterns of dynamic languages

# classifying patterns

* creational patterns
* structural
* behaviroral
